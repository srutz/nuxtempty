# Core Features of Vue 3

Vue 3 is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Here are its core features:

## 1. Composition API

The Composition API is a new way to organize component logic in Vue 3. It allows for better code reuse and organization, especially in larger applications.

- **Setup function**: The entry point for Composition API
- **Reactive References**: `ref` and `reactive`
- **Computed properties** and **Watchers**
- **Lifecycle hooks**

## 2. Improved Performance

Vue 3 offers significant performance improvements over its predecessor:

- **Virtual DOM rewrite**: Faster rendering and patching
- **Tree-shaking support**: Smaller bundle sizes
- **Optimized slots generation**: Better render performance

## 3. Teleport Component

`Teleport` allows you to render a component's content anywhere in the DOM tree, regardless of where the component is mounted.

## 4. Fragments

Vue 3 supports multiple root nodes in templates, eliminating the need for a single wrapping element.

## 5. Enhanced TypeScript Support

Improved TypeScript integration with better type inference.

## 6. Suspense Component

`Suspense` provides a way to handle asynchronous dependencies in your component tree.

## 7. Multiple v-models

Vue 3 allows components to have multiple `v-model` bindings, improving component flexibility.

## 8. Reactivity System Improvements

- `reactive()`: Deep reactivity
- `ref()`: Reactive references
- `toRef()` and `toRefs()`: Creating refs from reactive objects

## 9. Improved Tooling

- Vue CLI
- Vite: A faster build tool for modern web projects

## 10. Composition API for Libraries

The Composition API enables the creation of powerful, reusable logic across components and applications.

These features make Vue 3 more powerful, flexible, and performant than ever before.
